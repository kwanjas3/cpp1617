1.
the operator + returns the sum of (x + y) 
the operator += returns the reassignment of x where x = x + y
since the original object is being modified with the += operator
We return a reference.

2.
I used it when returning the reference of the += operator.
I also used it when creating a temp version of the current object
in the + operator.

3.
line 53 and line 57 when you call the (obj + obj).display(); is 
displaying the result stored in a temp object.

4.
having functionalized bool checks that were reused more than twice simplified 
my code alot;
in particular, using isValid() and isEmpty() saved
alot of lines and confusion when doing my if statements.

5. I learned how to overload operators and understand the operators
technically are what you want them to do with the object..
If for some reason I wanted += Fraction classes to multiply instead; I could
technically do that for "fun".
