1. It has to check for self assignment because 
if you do not, the copy assignment operator will delete the original data,
try to copy the deleted data to the original data giving you segmentation fault.

2.Classes that use resources need custom constructors and assignment operators to
manage memory and prevent scenarios where leaks happen. If a class needs memory,
you can design the constructor and copy assignment to do the necessary steps to
create the object/copy the object, then get rid of the old data before returning
the modified object.

3.You can use functions to avoid reusing code.

4.I have learned to be very cautious with dynamic memory management and keep calm and composed
while debugging.
