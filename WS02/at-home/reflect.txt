1. If dynamic memory is not deallocated, the program will begin to leak memory and eventually run out.
This will crash the program.

2. You need to allocate a new dynamic memory if you are increasing the size of the array because 
you cannot change the structure of an array once it is created. 
Therefore, you make a new array of the size you want,
copy old array into the new array,
and then delete the old array and unallocate the old dynamic memory it was using.

3. No because it was encapsulated by the kingdom struct and we deleted the whole struct. The character name has a static
number of bytes allocated for the name which was 32 characters.

4. We use function overloading which allows us to use the same function name as long as it has different arguments.
C++ allows this because the signature includes the arguments.

5. I learned function overloading and similarities between setting dynamic memory with opening files in C.
